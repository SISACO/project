        <img src="{% static 'iedc_image.jpg' %}" alt="IEDC Image">
        <p>New Generation Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (NewGen IEDC) is the programme launched by National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB),<br>
            Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India. NewGen IEDC will aim to inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship amongst the young S&T students, encourage and support start-up creation through guidance, mentorship and support.
            The programme will be implemented in academic institutions. Students will be encouraged to take up innovative projects with possibility of commercialization.
            NewGen IEDCs would also spread the message of entrepreneurship and create a culture of entrepreneurship in the Host Institution (HI). <br>
            With faculty already trained in the nuances of entrepreneurship, the presence of NewGen IEDCs in HI would create a vibrant entrepreneurial culture amongst the students. Few amongst the “Job-Seekers” would be converted to “JobGenerators” through the entrepreneurial route.</p>
